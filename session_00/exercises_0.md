# Session 0 Exercises

## Section A

Before you start, make sure that you are using the Shell 🐚 (not the console).

1. Use `pwd` to check in what directory you are.

2. Use `ls` to check what files and folders are in the current directory.

3. Using `cd <directory_name>` go into the "session_00" directory.

4. Create a new folder named "my_first_folder" using `mkdir <directory_name>`.

5. Delete the empty folder "my_first_folder" using `rmdir <directory_name>`.

6. Create a new folder named "animals" using `mkdir <directory_name>`.

7. Get into the animals folder by using `cd <directory_name>`.

8. Create 3 text files named "penguins.txt", "dogs.txt", "roses.txt" by using `touch <file_name.txt>`.
    - Extra challenge: Can you do this while using `touch` only once?

9. Create your first python file called "snakes.py" by using `touch <file_name.py>`.

10. Delete the roses.txt file with the `rm <file_name.txt>` command.

11. Display the text "I love whippets!" to to the terminal by using `echo <text>`.

12. Write the line "Whippet" in the dogs.txt file using `echo <text> > <file_name.txt>`.

13. Display what is inside the dogs.txt file by using `cat <file_name.txt>`.

15. Display the date in the terminal using the `date` command.

15. Display the recent history of your bash commands using the `history` command.

16. Clear your terminal with the `clear` command.


# Section B

1. Get out of the `animals` folder using `cd ..` .

2. Create a Markdown file called "my_markdown_recipe" using `touch <file_name.md>`.

3. Inside the "my_markdown_recipe.md" file, type a recipe you like using the Markdown syntax. If you don't have any ideas, or writing up in Markdown seems too much of a chore, just ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to write one for you (Ex: "Come up with a recipe in markdown format."), then paste it into your file. 
    - When you are done, click on the "open preview" option to see the formatted version.

Great job on getting so far, just one more section to go!

# Section C

1. Get out of the "session_00" folder using `cd ..` .

2. Make sure you are in the "intro-to-python" directory by using the `pwd` command.

3. Use the `git add .` command to stage all the work you have done.

4. Commit your work with `git commit -m "<Short description of what you have worked on.>"`.

5. Push your work to GitHub with `git push origin main`.

Congratulations, all your work is now updated and stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

touch <file_name.txt/file_name.py> # Creates new file

rm <file_name.txt/file_name.py> # Deletes file



echo <text> # Displays in the terminal a line of text, Ex: echo Hello! --> Hello!

echo <text> > <file_name.txt>  # Writes a line of text in a file, Ex: echo Bonjour! > file.txt
        # The > overwrites the file if it exists or creates it if it doesn't exist.
        # The >> appends to a file or creates the file if it doesn't exist. 
        
cat <file_name.txt> # Reads the file and displays it line by line in the terminal,
