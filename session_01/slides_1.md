# Operating Systems (OS)

- Software that communicates with machine hardware.​

- Some include a graphical user interface (GUI) for manipulation (Windows, MAC OS)​.

- Linux has multiple distributions - some can include a GUI (e.g. Ubuntu), while some don’t.​


---

# Linux

- Popular operating system based on UNIX​.

- Open-source, multiple distributions​.

- Commonly used for hosting web servers and scientific computing.


---

# Command-line Interface (CLI) and Bash

- Also referred to as the ‘Console’ or ‘Terminal’.​

- Used to run programs, manage files and interact with the computer.

---

# Bash - Bourne Again SHell

- Command Language for most Linux distributions​

- sh = Bourne Shell​

- The Shell is the layer between the Operating System and the User (or other services)

- Terminal app on your Mac (you will have it by default because Mac OS is UNIX based) or Git Bash on your Windows (needs downloading).

# Bash commands

```bash
pwd # Prints to the console the path of your current working directory

ls # Lists the files in the directory you are in


cd <directory_name> # Gets in a given directory

cd .. # Gets out of the directory you are in

```

---

# More bash commands

```bash
mkdir <directory_name> # Creates new directory

rmdir <directory_name> # Deletes an empty Directory (Folder)

rm -r <directory_name> # Deletes the directory and its contents recursively


touch <file_name.txt/file_name.py> # Creates new file

rm <file_name.txt/file_name.py> # Deletes file


mv original_file1 /home/newfile1 # Moves a file (can be used for renaming) ​

cp original_filename copy_filename # Makes a copy of a file

```

---

# More bash commands

```bash
echo <text> # Displays in the terminal a line of text, Ex: echo Hello!

echo <text> > <file_name.txt>  # Writes a line of text in a file, Ex: echo Bonjour! > file.txt

cat <file_name.txt> # Reads the file and displays it line by line in the terminal, Ex: cat file.txt --> Bonjour!


history  # Displays your recently run Bash Commands​

date # Displays the date

man <command> # Displays the manual and description for the chosen command -> ex: man ls/pwd/cd/mkdir


clear  # Clears the terminal screen



```

---

# Bash shortcuts

- TAB - autocompletes commands, file names, or directory names for you​.

- UP/DOWN Arrows - Scroll backward and forwards through previous commands you’ve typed in the current session. ​

- F3 - Repeat the previous command​.

- CTRL + C -  Abort the current line you’re typing or a command that is currently executing​.

# Source Control Management(SCM)

- Refers to tools used to track modifications to a source code repository.​

- Source Control Management = Version Control​

---

# Why do we use Source Control?

- Helps teams work collaboratively.

- Developers can edit shared code without unknowingly overwriting each other’s work.

- Serves as a protection mechanism.


--- 

# Git

- Git (Global Information Tracker) = a version control system.​

- Why Git? ​-> Because of its popularity, community, opensource nature, and decentralised approach.

---

# Git - What does it do?

- Allows you to *collaborate* on a project without interfering with each other’s work.​

- Keeps a historical record of everyone's work so you can go back to previous records.​

- You can work on your local copy of the codebase and then merge your changes with the main codebase.​

- Uses a series of snapshots, called commits, to track changes to the codebase over time along with the timestamp and user who made the changes.

---

# Terminology

### Remote Repository​

- This is where everyone shares their code centrally (ex: GitHub). ​


### Local Repository​

 - When you commit your code, a local version is created on your machine.

 ---

 # Basic Git commmands

 ```bash
git clone <https://github.com/sergiuHudrea/intro-to-python.git>  
          # Copies an existing Git repository from a remote location to your local machine.​


git init  # Initializes an existing directory as a Git repository.


git status  # Shows the current status of the repository, including which files have been modified, 
    # which files have been added to the staging area, and which files are not being tracked by Git.
 ```

 ---

 # Basic Git commands

 ```bash

git add . # Adds ALL changes to the staging area in preparation for committing them to the repository.​

git commit -m "<Short description of what you have worked on.>" 
        # Saves changes to the local repository, along with your commit message, usually describing the changes.

git push origin main # Uploads local changes to your remote repository, on the main branch.

git pull origin main # Downloads changes from the remote repository (main branch) 
                # and incorporates them into your local repository.

 ```

---

# Markdown and README.md

- When creating a repository, you usually start off by writing a **README.md** file in a Markup language called Markdown.​

- The **README.md** summarises important information about the contents of the repo, instructions on how to edit or run the software, etc.​

- *Markdown* is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.


---

# IDEs

- **IDE** = An Integrated development environment is a software for application building. It combines tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI).​

- Why use an IDE? ​--> The tools needed are already there and ready to use. It is efficient and makes life easier.​

- Imagine repairing a car in a parking lot VS repairing it in a garage.​

- You can develop applications without an IDE, but the you would have to build your own IDE by manually integrating the tools you need.​

- Replit = a cloud IDE --> No need for downloading software and configuring local environments. No more "But it works on my machine".
