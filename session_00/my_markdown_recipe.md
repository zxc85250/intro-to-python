Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe
Ingredients
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup brown sugar, packed
2 large eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 cups chocolate chips
Instructions
Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.

Beat in the eggs, one at a time, followed by the vanilla extract, until well combined.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.

Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, mixing until just combined.

Stir in the chocolate chips, distributing them evenly throughout the dough.

Drop rounded tablespoonfuls of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown.

Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes.

Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy your freshly baked chocolate chip cookies!
