# Intro to Python
The course is a total beginner’s introduction to programming. It takes students from zero to being able to write their own programs in 10 sessions. It teaches the logic and mindset needed to break down complex tasks into individual steps and have a computer execute them. It opens up students minds to how technology and applications they use on a daily basis work, and allows them to get inspired by how technology can change their everyday lives. Most importantly it shows them that no matter their background/knowledge level/age, that they can learn new things and that programming is something they can do and (mostly like) enjoy.

# Syllabus 

The course breakdown is as follows:

## Session 0 - Fundamentals
• Operating systems (OS)
• Command-line interface (CLI)
• Bourne Again SHell (Bash)
• Source control management (SCM) - Git
• Integrated development environment (IDE)
• Markdown

This session introduces students to operating systems, how developers work collaboratively and how to use the computer via the command-line interface. They also learn about how developers use IDEs to make their life easier and how to write simple formatted documents using Markdown.
 
## Session 1 & 2 – Getting started with Python
•	Intro to programming
•	“Hello World”
•	Variables
•	Basic Math
•	Accepting input
 
These sessions outline what programming is and gets attendees writing and running their first programs. They learn about how to output information, calculate basic maths, accept user input and start to process it.
 
## Session 3 & 4 – Conditionals
•	If/else statements
•	Collections -  Lists
•	For loops
 
These sessions get students using basic logic to adapt the flow of execution within their programs. They also learn about their first basic data structure and loop through them to show the same piece of code being run multiple times.
 
## Session 5 & 6 – Loops & Collections
•	While loops
•	Collections – Dictionaries
•	Advanced Lists
 
These sessions extends the students basic knowledge around data structures and how to loop through code in more ways. They learn how to extend their programs by including modules of code written by others.
 
## Session 7  – Functions
•	What / Why / How
 
These sessions introduce functions, what they are, why they are used, how to use them. It takes all the knowledge they have previously learnt and teaches them how to start writing more manageable and re-usable code.
 
## Session 8 – Files
•	Read
•	Write
 
These sessions teaches how to read and write data to files. Students calculate values from data within files, and write results out to other files. It builds from their existing knowledge and gets them to use the logic they have learnt to process data on a larger scale.
 
## Session 9 - Software development lifecycle (SDLC) & Command-line project
•	SDLC
•   Agile Model
•   Programming principles
•	How to build a Command-line project
•   Kanban

This session introduces students to various strategies, tools and models developers (and not only) use to work efficiently. They will also learn how to build a command line app on their own using all the principles, skills and knowledge accumulated.
